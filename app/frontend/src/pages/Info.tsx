              Document Chat Application utilizes the GPT4All created by
              Nomic AI, an information cartography company that aims to improve access to AI resources. The chat
              is designed to run without the need of GPU, and it
              stores the latest document sent by user in user-level isolated
              data storage.

            <strong className="inline text-xl">
              You can only see the documents that you have uploaded yourself. No
              chats or other information is shared between the users.
